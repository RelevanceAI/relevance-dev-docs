Deploy as a managed scalable api in one click.
```
chain.deploy()
```
Thats it now you can use it anywhere.

Where you can use the chain:
- Notebook, our low-code interface to consume the chain as a frontend app or adjust the prompts etc in that same interface
- API, you can hit the deployed chain as an API from anywhere
- Python/Javascript SDK

For each of these details on how to use it will be printed once you hit `chain.deploy()`
