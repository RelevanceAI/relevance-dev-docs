## What is Relevance AI?

With Relevance AI, you can build highly-skilled agents and multi-agent teams that follow your unique company processes and use your tech stack, much like a human employee would. You can delegate whole or parts of a role to an autonomous AI agent or team of agents, and infinitely scale their impact.

## Why the Python SDK? 

The Python SDK is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with Relevance AI's API. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for using agents, tools, and knowledge.
