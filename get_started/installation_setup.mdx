## Create an account

Before you get started, make sure you create an account and install Relevance AI.

1. Sign up for a free account at https://app.relevanceai.com and then login to your Relevance AI account.
2. Create a new secret key at https://app.relevanceai.com/login/sdk. Scroll to the bottom of the integrations page and click on "+ Create new secret key" and select "Admin" permissions.

## Install our package

Install the RelevanceAI library in a Python 3 environment by running the following command in your terminal
```terminal Terminal
pip install relevanceai
```

## Setup your client

Create the RelevanceAI client by importing the library.

```python Python
from relevanceai import RelevanceAI
client = RelevanceAI()
```

You can validate the client credentials by storing the following environment variables and loading them into your project with `python-dotenv` or `os` library. Your client should run without any errors.


```env .env
RAI_API_KEY=
RAI_REGION=
RAI_PROJECT=
```
```python Python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from relevanceai import RelevanceAI
client = RelevanceAI()
```

Or you can pass the credentials directly to the client.
```python Python
from relevanceai import RelevanceAI
client = RelevanceAI(
    api_key="your_api_key", 
    region="your_region", 
    project="your_project"
)
```

You are now ready to start using Relevance AI via the Python SDK.
