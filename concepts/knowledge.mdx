## Listing Knowledge Sets

To list all knowledge sets available in your project, use the `list_knowledge` method:

```python Python
my_knowledge_sets = client.knowledge.list_knowledge()
my_knowledge_sets
````


````terminal
[KnowledgeSet(set_id="xxxxxx", name="Knowledge Set 1"), KnowledgeSet(set_id="xxxxxx", name="Knowledge Set 2")]
````


## Retrieving Knowledge

To retrieve data from a specific knowledge set, use the `retrieve_knowledge` method with the `knowledge_set` name:

````python Python
my_knowledge_data = client.knowledge.retrieve_knowledge(knowledge_set="xxxxxx") # use the table name here 

my_knowledge_data
````


````terminal
[KnowledgeRow(row_id="xxxxxx", data={"field1": "value1", "field2": "value2"}), KnowledgeRow(row_id="xxxxxx", data={"field1": "value3", "field2": "value4"})]
````


## Deleting a Knowledge Set

To delete a knowledge set, use the `delete_knowledge` method with the `knowledge_set` name:

````python Python
success = client.knowledge.delete_knowledge(knowledge_set="xxxxxx")
success
````


````terminal
True
````
