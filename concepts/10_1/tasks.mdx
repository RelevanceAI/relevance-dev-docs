## Getting Task Metadata

To get metadata for a specific task, use the `get_metadata` method with the `conversation_id`:

```python Python
metadata = client.tasks.get_metadata(
    conversation_id="xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
)

metadata
```

```terminal
Metadata(...)
```

## Deleting a Task

To delete a task, use the `delete_task` method with the `conversation_id`:

```python Python
success = client.tasks.delete_task(
    conversation_id="xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
)

success
```

```terminal
True
```
