You can see all of our latest steps at:

from relevanceai as rai
rai.list_all_steps()
```

You can run any of those steps via:
```python Python
from relevanceai.steps import RunStep

step = RunStep(step_id)
```
This will error with all the appropriate fields.
```python Python
from relevanceai.steps import RunStep

step = RunStep("prompt_completion", prompt="hello")
```
