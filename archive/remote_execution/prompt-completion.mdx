# LLM, Prompt completion step

Lets run the LLM.
```python Python
from relevanceai.steps import PromptCompletion

llm = PromptCompletion(
  prompt="Hello world",
  model="openai-gpt35"
)
llm.run()
```

Lets use a different model. You can get the list of supported models here https://sdk.relevanceai.com/creating-chains/supported-models.
```python Python
llm = PromptCompletion(
  prompt="Hello world",
  model="anthropic-claude-instant-v1"
)
llm.run()
```

## `RunChain` Class

The `RunChain` class is a subclass of `StepBase` and represents a step in the relevance.ai pipeline. It is used to execute a chain of steps specified by a `chain_id` and `params`.

### Constructor

#### Parameters

- `chain_id` (str): The ID of the chain to be executed.
- `params` (dict): A dictionary containing the parameters for the chain.
- `step_name` (str, optional): The name of the step. Defaults to "run_chain".
- `*args` and `**kwargs`: Additional arguments and keyword arguments.

### Properties

- `steps`: Returns a list containing a single dictionary representing the step configuration.

### Step Configuration

The `RunChain` class generates a step configuration dictionary that can be used in the relevance.ai pipeline. The step configuration contains the following fields:

- `transformation` (str): The transformation type, which is set to "run_chain" for this step.
- `name` (str): The name of the step, as specified in the `step_name` parameter.
- `foreach` (str): An empty string, indicating that the step does not iterate over any input.
- `output` (dict): A dictionary mapping output names to their corresponding values. The output names are generated based on the `_outputs` list.
- `params` (dict): A dictionary containing the `chain_id` and `params` for the chain.

### Output Names

The `RunChain` class defines a list of output names in the `_outputs` attribute. These names include:

- `output`: The output of the chain execution.
- `state`: The state of the chain execution.
- `status`: The status of the chain execution.
- `errors`: Any errors that occurred during the chain execution.
- `cost`: The cost of the chain execution.
- `credits_used`: The amount of credits used for the chain execution.
- `executionTime`: The time taken for the chain execution.

The output names are used to generate the `outputs` property, which provides a list of fully-qualified output paths for the step configuration.

**Note:** The double curly braces (`{{ }}`) in the output configuration indicate placeholders that will be replaced with the actual values during the pipeline execution.

This `RunChain` class is designed to be used as a step in the relevance.ai pipeline to execute a chain of steps and retrieve the results.
